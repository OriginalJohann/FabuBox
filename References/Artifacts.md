# Artifacts
## Symphony of Ruin - First movement (Satz)
The first part of an ominous symphony. Written by someone who has seen the end of all things, nobody seems to be able to ever play it. Obviously unfinished, the composition draws it's owner to any other parts of the symphony. The effect is equal to that of a Ritualism Ritual of medium power targeting an individual, which does not require Mind Points - the Magic Check is performed as usual.
