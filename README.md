# FabuBox
My Obsidian-vault for preparing Fabula Ultima TTJRPG.

## Usage
1. Copy all files into a directory that you want to use as your vault
2. Open Obsidian.md and clock "Open folder as vault" choosing the created directory
3. Move appearence.json into the newly created .obsidian folder (mainly for accent color)
4. Move snippets into .obsidian
5. Use the community plugins to install **Admonition**, **Advanced Tables**, **Dataview**, **Fantasy Statblocks**, **Homepage**, **Image Converter**, **Minimal Theme Settings**, **Omnisearch** and **Style Settings**
6. Install the **Minimal Theme**
7. Move data.json into .obsidian/plugins/obsidian-5e-statblocks (has template for statblock)
8. Set directories as needed in config (e.g. Data- and Template-directories)
9. Enable all snippets under Appearance

## Tips
1. Save your creatures by clicking on the three dots next to the rendered statblock
2. For saving space convert all your images to .webp-format
3. Feel free to use statblocks exported from https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/
