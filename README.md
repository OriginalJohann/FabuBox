# FabuBox
My Obsidian-vault for preparing Fabula Ultima TTJRPG and world building.

## Setup
1. Copy all files into a directory that you want to use as your vault
2. Open Obsidian.md and clock "Open folder as vault" choosing the created directory
3. Move appearence.json into the newly created ".obsidian" folder (mainly for accent color)
4. Move snippets into ".obsidian"
5. Use the community plugins to install **Admonition**, **Advanced Tables**, **Dataview**, **Fantasy Statblocks**, **Homepage**, **Image Converter**, **Minimal Theme Settings**, **Omnisearch** and **Style Settings**
6. Install the **Minimal Theme**
7. Move data.json into ".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-5e-statblocks" (has template for FabU statblocks)
8. Set directories as needed in config (e.g. default Data- and Template-directories)
9. Enable all snippets under "Appearance"

## Usage
The "Beastiary" is used for storing all your adversary creations. Feel free to use Fultimator exports instead of my statblocks. 

"Characters" is the directory for writing down all information about every important character you will ever create.

The "Files" directory is used for storing all external files that you want to use during play. I split images into "Mapping" and "Artwork" for better ordering.

"Locations" is the place for writing down everything about the fantastical locations, my players are visiting during their adventures. Because I plan on reusing some of them, the information written down won't be campaign specific.

For some general pieces of content use the "Notes" directory. The files presented in there should be self explanatory. 

I also have some information that I don't want to look up in the rules everytime noted down in "References". Examples for that are rituals, usage of Fabula Points, general economy and travel rules. For legal reasons I can't add them to this repo. The "Tables"-note is meant for declaring dataview tables that are commonly used throughout the entire vault. The "GM-Screen" is a great example for how to use them.

The concept of conflicts is realized in the "Situations" section. Players tend to overthrow your planning especially with Fabula Points but having a basic idea of what you want to do is great.

For writing down new notes faster I made a bunch of "Templates" for all kinds of notes used inside this vault.

My most important directory is "Worlds". Here I give an overview over created worlds and the campaigns played in them. Inside the campaign directory I always create a session-note at the start of a new session. Right now I have to write down the current date myself. Maybe I will automate that with Templater later (https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

## Tips
1. Save your creatures by clicking on the three dots next to the rendered statblock
2. For saving space convert all your images to .webp-format
3. Feel free to use statblocks exported from https://fabula-ultima-helper.web.app/
4. If you don't like my way of making maps, I can recommend the Leaflet-plugin (https://github.com/javalent/obsidian-leaflet) for creating better and more interactive ones
5. For drawing on a canvas use the Excalidraw-plugin (https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)
